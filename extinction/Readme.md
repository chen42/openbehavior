# Using a Raspberry Pi to run extinction sessions

We have several old operant chamber where the electronics are starting to fail. This project uses a RPi to record the number of licks on two spouts. There is also a constantly flashing visual cue during the session. We now use these to run the contextual extinction sessions as described in our earlier papers <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/25532105> by Wang et al. (2014)  </a> and  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/25566005"> by Wang et al. (2014) </a>. ￼ 

The *extinctionCase* holds the RPi.  The *extinctionCueLightPlate* holds the cue light for one side. The *extinctionCueLightBox* is inserted into the *extinctionCase* and holds the other set of cue lights. The *extinctionCaseCover* has an opening for an LCD, which displays session info and data. 

The device is running either from a 5V DC microusb power supply or using a large 5V cell phone backup battery.
