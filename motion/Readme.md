#Adding motion sensor to operant conditioning chambers

## Description
This project  adds a motion sensor to the commercial MedPC operant chambers. The motion sensor is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single board computer. The RPi is powered by the 28V power source available in the operant chamber. The RPi is turned on and off via MedPC programs. The data are stored in the SD card of the Pi. Each operant chamber use one Pi. All the Pi computers are connected by a WiFi network and data are transferred to a center location using a peer-to-peer protocol via syncthing.
