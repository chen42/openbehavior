openbehavior
============

This project aims to establish a computing platform for rodent behavior research using the Raspberry Pi computer. We intend to build programs for conducting operant conditioning, as well as some infrared sensor based assays. We also intend to create an environmental sensor set that records the temperature, humidity, air pressure, ambient light, noise level, etc.
